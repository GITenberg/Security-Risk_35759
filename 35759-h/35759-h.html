</div>
<p class="pfirst">At moments like this, General
David Walker always
thought fleetingly of the good old
days when he had hated the army.
As usual, he smashed the thought
out of his mind with a distinct sense
of remorse.</p>
<p class="pnext">He looked up again at the
seamed face of the Chief of Staff,
General Marcus Meriwether. "This
could be serious," he said slowly,
with a sick sense of the statement's
inadequacy. An old tic suddenly
returned, tugging at the left corner
of his mouth.</p>
<p class="pnext">The deadly, unsmiling expression
on Meriwether's face did not
change as he slid more tightly into
his chair. "You know as well as I
that it means the Interplanetary
Confederation is ready to go to war
with us."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker stared at the typed statement
on his desk. It was a decoded
intelligence message from United
Terra's prime agent in the Interplanetary
Confederation, and it
was very brief: the Confederation
had developed a long-range neural
weapon effectively cancelling out
every armament development
achieved by United Terra in fifteen
years of a cold war that of late had
become bitter cold. The all-but-autonomous
colonies of Mars and
Venus, united now for twenty years
in an economic league, had been
itching for independence for a
quarter of a century. The itch had
developed into a mighty burning.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You are fully aware," Meriwether
continued, his face still set,
"of our feeling that the Confederation
has been eager to take on
Terra. They've clearly been waiting
for some positive advantage to offset
our pure strength-in-numbers."</p>
<div class="align-center auto-scaled figure" style="margin-left: 43%; width: 13%" id="figure-2">
<img style="display: block; width: 100%" alt="images/im1.png" src="images/im1.png" width="100%"/>
<div class="caption italics">
<em class="italics">It was a touchable
touching an untouchable.
Both scientist and general
were doing their own
version of right....</em></div>
</div>
<p class="pfirst">Walker forced his eyes upward
and stared at his superior. "Your
tone says that such a war might
be—"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Unwelcome at this time. Unwelcome
at this time." Meriwether
shifted around in his chair, and
scratched at its leather arms with
the manicured tips of his gnarled
fingers. "Walker, I don't have to
tell you that this weapon, if it is
what our agent infers—and there
is no reason to believe otherwise—that
this weapon makes it impossible
for us to go to war with the
Confederation—unless, as Chief of
Weapons Development, you can
tell me that we have something in
our arsenal to combat it."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker rubbed at the tic. "Nothing,"
he said quietly.</p>
<p class="pnext">Meriwether leaned forward, his
hands crooked backward against
the chair arms like catapult springs.
"That answer is unacceptable.
There are other questions you must
answer, Walker, questions in some
ways even more important than
that basic one. Why haven't we developed
this weapon ourselves?
Why haven't we been aware of its
potential existence? Where are the
defensive devices which would naturally
develop from such cognizance?
These things are all your
department, Walker." His voice
pitched upward an hysterical fraction.
"It just doesn't make sense,
you know. We've a hundred times
the personnel, ten times the facilities,
unlimited funds—but they've
beaten us to it." He stood up and
pushed his chair back, eyes squinting
out of a reddening face that
seemed on the point of bursting.
"Why, Walker?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Once again Walker thought
about how he had hated the army
when he was a bright young physics
student. That was a long time ago—So
much had happened. The
doors had closed around him, one
at a time, doors closing on the scientific
mind. And so now, instead of a
research scientist in white smock
with textbook, he was a military
administrator in smart greys with
glittering stars of military rank.</p>
<p class="pnext">"I'll say this, Walker," Meriwether
shouted, his voice breaking
again. "We'd better catch up quick.
Mighty quick. Let's put it this way.
It might mean your rank and your
job, Walker. But you won't give a
damn. Because we'll have lost the
war. We'll have lost the colonies.
And you know what that would
mean, Walker?" He bent forward
across the desk, his face exploding
into Walker's eyes. "Only a fool believes
that United Terra can survive
in an economy without tri-planetary
hegemony.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Walker, you've all the authority
within my power to grant. You'll
have no trouble getting money. But—get
the answer. <em class="italics">Quick.</em>"</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker blinked after him as he
strode to the door. "I'll try to hold
off a federal investigation as long
as I can," Meriwether added, turning
from the half-opened door.
"But I can't guarantee a thing."</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p class="pfirst">Walker sat alone in a cubicle of
light in the darkened city and
gulped down his twentieth cup of
coffee. It had grown cold in the
cup and with a grimace he pushed
it aside.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was no doubt about it. He
thumbed through the sheaf of scribbled
notes he had transcribed from
stacks of documents and racks of
spools from Security files. Clearly,
he had the answer to Meriwether's
questions. But, having it, he did not
quite know what to do with it.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was, however, no doubt at
all: United Terra had been on the
track of the neural weapon—ten
years earlier. Could have had it—and
had lost the chance.</p>
<p class="pnext">He rubbed his thumbs hard
against his tired eyes and tried to
remember back that ten years: at
that time he had been Chief of
Weapons Development for perhaps
three years. His own name, though,
had appeared in none of the files
he had examined, so apparently he
had not been directly involved in
the security hearings. But he <em class="italics">should</em>
remember.</p>
<p class="pnext">Dr. Otto Millet. <em class="italics">Otto Millet.</em> He
let the name roll around his brain,
until shortly an image began to
form—an image of a smiling man,
greying at the temples, wearing a
flamboyant sports shirt and affecting
a very close haircut. A man perhaps
forty. In the image, he was a
laughing man.</p>
<p class="pnext">He remembered now. Dr. Otto
Millet: into government service on
the inertia of a fantastic reputation
as a research physicist specializing
in magnetic field studies. A man he
had instantly disliked.</p>
<p class="pnext">He bent forward and reread
what he had scrawled in his last
notes, a verbatim extract from the
report of the security committee.</p>
<p class="pnext">"It is clear that Dr. Millet's
conversations and letters with Professor
Greyman, together with his
unrepentant attitude, render him a
security risk. His various security
clearances are therefore revoked,
and he is hereafter prohibited access
to all classified files and to any
government research and development
laboratory."</p>
<p class="pnext">Since virtually all laboratories
were government supported, that
was to all intents and purposes the
end of Millet's career as an experimental
physicist.</p>
<p class="pnext">Where had Millet gone? What
had he done since? Walker scraped
a cigarette out of the half-empty
pack in his pocket. More important:
what was he doing now?</p>
<p class="pnext">He inhaled deeply and sent
clouds of smoke skewing across the
room. Had the man really been a
traitor? Walker tried to place himself
in the time of Millet's hearing.
He'd been not too many years out
of school then, with the bitterness
of his frustrated ambition to be a
research physicist still rankling him;
perhaps this had colored his view
of Millet. He stared at his desk,
almost shocked that this thought
should have occurred to him. It
shook him, for it told him something
about himself which he did
not particularly care to know.</p>
<p class="pnext">Nowhere had he been able to find
any evidence as to what had happened
to Millet since. Banished, the
government seemed to forget him.
But one thing was clear to Walker,
and he pondered it deeply as he
sucked on the last quarter-inch of
his cigarette and poured himself
another cup of cold black coffee.
One big thing: Millet had been
directing development along lines
that would have led to the neural
weapon; he had even signed a report,
early in his project effort,
which had referred to the possibility
of "a neural device."</p>
<p class="pnext">Had he gone over to the Confederation?
It would account for
their possession of the weapon now.
But surely—<em class="italics">surely</em>, this fact would
have been observed and reported
by Terran intelligence agents.</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker, infinitely tired, forgot his
coffee and began to tidy up the
desk, filing everything he wanted to
keep in an electronically locked
cabinet, shoving everything else into
the destruction of the vibrator. He
pondered for a moment the powdered
secrets that were heaped like
black dust in the bottom of the canister:
a symbol of safety to a terrified world.</p>
<p class="pnext">Step one: find Millet. <em class="italics">Find Millet.</em></p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p class="pfirst">It took the Secret Service
exactly twenty-nine hours to locate
Dr. Otto Millet. Thirty minutes
later, Walker was climbing out
of a government helicopter and
staring at Millet's small house
through squinted eyes which he
shielded with both hands against
the blazing desert sun. The house
was fronted by a neat lawn and a
white fence entwined with red
roses; there appeared to be a rather
large garden in the rear. The style
of the house bothered him a little:
it had passed out of popularity
thirty years before. Its lack of a
conventional roofport had forced
them to land the 'copter on the
desert itself.</p>
<p class="pnext">He straightened and pushed
through the creaking gate. Flagstone
steps curved toward the
porch, and he minced along them,
uncertain, now that he had arrived,
of what he would say to Millet. The
damned house, he thought—so different
from what he had expected;
it had thrown his whole thinking
out of order.</p>
<p class="pnext">He hated himself for feeling uneasy.</p>
<p class="pnext">There was neither vodor nor contact
system of any kind at the door,
and he brushed his hand against his
forehead in a gesture of frustration.
He stared at his palm—it had come
away wet with sweat, and he wondered
if it were all because of the
desert sun.</p>
<p class="pnext">Tentatively, he banged on the
door with his fist. There was no
answer.</p>
<p class="pnext"><em class="italics">Damn Millet</em>, he thought, wiping
his forehead again. Why couldn't
the man have a videophone like
any normal person so you could
find out if he were home without
taking a trip halfway across the
country?</p>
<p class="pnext">He turned, stamping angrily as
he did so, and was startled to see a
man, wearing work clothes and
holding a pair of heavy soiled gloves
in his left hand, standing on the
ground by the end of the porch. He
was nearly bald, intensely bronzed,
and he was smiling.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Wondered when you'd see me."
He nodded toward the gate. "I was
standing right there when you came
up. You just breezed right past."
His smile broadened. "You were so
interested in being surprised that
you couldn't see what you came
for."</p>
<p class="pnext">"It must have been that damned
glare," muttered Walker, shaking
his head. Then, impolitely, "Are
you Millet?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Otto Millet," the other replied,
inclining his head slightly. "You're
from the government. I can tell
because of the uniform, you see."
Walker flushed. "The government
hasn't thought about me in a number
of years," the scientist added.
He came up onto the porch and
peered at the symbol on the left
lapel of Walker's jacket. "Ah! Alma
mater. Weapons Development."
He squinted at Walker. "David
Walker, I presume?" He chuckled
loudly but Walker failed to see the
humor. "I remember you, you see;
what a shame you can't return the
compliment."</p>
<p class="pnext">"It's hot out here," complained
Walker, in growing discomfort.</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet opened the door. "Won't
you come in? It's better inside."</p>
<p class="pnext">There it was again, thought
Walker; the insolence, the imperturbable
smile. He grunted and
went in; it was, mercifully, considerably
cooler.</p>
<p class="pnext">He looked around. It was a very
cluttered living room, not messy but
tossed about with the artifacts that
the man obviously liked to have
around him. There was an ancient
painting by Bonestell hanging on
one wall, a startlingly accurate
twentieth-century concept of the
appearance of Mars; several long
pipe racks, filled to overflowing, in
various spots around the room; a
typewriter on a table in a corner,
and piles of paper; books lining the
walls, and stacked on the floor in
heaps and on the table beside the
typewriter; a map of the earth on
the wall above the typewriter, a
three-dimensional Waterson projection.
The furniture was clean but—not
old; <em class="italics">lived with</em>.</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker went over to the wall
map and peered closely.</p>
<p class="pnext">"One of Waterson's first," remarked
Millet, closing the door.
"Sit down, Walker, and tell me all
about Weapons Development. How
is the mass murder department doing
these days?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker felt his ears redden and
he was arrested in the very act of
sitting down. "Really," he said, "it's
not something we <em class="italics">like</em> to think
about, you know."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Suppose not." Millet fiddled
with several pipes in a rack beside
his chair, selected one, and began
filling it with rough-cut tobacco
from a battered canister. "To
business, then. Why the visit?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker cleared his throat and
tried to remember the little prefatory
weasel words he had painfully
assembled during the flight from
Omaha. "First of all, Dr. Millet, I
find myself a little embarrassed.
After all, your parting from government
service was not of the happiest
nature for you—"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't be foolish. Happiest day
of my life, Walker."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker had a sudden sense of
being impaled, and the rest of the
little speech was dissipated in the
wave of shock which swept over
him. He forced his mouth shut, and
gasped, "You're not serious!"</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet shook out his second
match and puffed until the pipe
bowl glowed warmly, edge to edge.
"Of course I'm serious." He jabbed
his pipe at Walker. "You like your
job?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"It's a job that has to be done."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet smiled and shrugged.
"You haven't really answered my
question."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker, sensing that he had already
lost control of the conversation,
waved his hands in dismissal.
"Well, that is not really important.
The fact remains, you did leave
Weapons Development at the ...
ah ... request of the government."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Talk on, talk on—you'll get to
the point eventually. When you're
through, I'd like to show you
around the place. I'm very proud
of my gardens. You're sort of
responsible for them, you know."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker set his jaw and bored
ahead. "However, at the time you
left government service, you were
pursuing certain lines of research—"</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet leaned back and began
laughing, his eyes squinted shut.
"Walker, don't tell me they want
me <em class="italics">back</em>!"</p>
<p class="pnext">It seemed his chance to dominate
the discussion again. "I don't think
you'd be allowed back."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Good," said Millet, looking up,
his laughter fading into a smile.
"I was a bit concerned for a moment."</p>
<p class="pnext">There was silence in the room.
Walker began to wish that he were
somewhere else: Millet simply baffled
him. He obviously did not care
about his disgrace. Walker felt a
resurgence of the old resentment.</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet's face suddenly became
very kindly. "Perhaps, as a fellow
scientist"—Walker almost winced,
and knew, furiously, that his
response had shown—"you would
be interested in knowing what I've
been doing since my unhappy marriage
with bureaucracy ended."</p>
<p class="pnext">It was a welcome gambit, and
Walker accepted it eagerly. "I certainly
would. One of the reasons I
came here, as a matter of fact."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet waved his pipe. "Good.
Afterwards, you can stop beating
around the bush, eh?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Yes, of course," mumbled
Walker.</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know," said Millet as he
got up and went to a bookcase, "a
man's got to earn a living. Do much
reading?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Not these days. Used to." He
scratched a cigarette on the sole of
his shoe and inhaled hugely. "Not
enough time these days for reading."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet reached into the bookcase
and came out with a stack of magazines.
"Well, that's how I make my
living." He handed the stack to
Walker. "Writing. Use a pen name
of course." He chuckled. "Write
everything—always happiest doing
science fiction, though."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker flipped through the
magazines; he looked up. "Obviously,
you're doing rather well at
it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Have been for the last seven or
eight years. Lot of fun."</p>
<p class="pnext">"And this has been your life
since you left us?" Walker set the
stack of magazines aside. "Seems a
waste of genius, somehow."</p>
<p class="pnext">"As a matter of fact, this is not
my life's work. As I said, a man's
got to earn a living. This is just a
lucrative hobby that pays the way.
You see, I've been involved in an
expensive research program."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Ah." Walker sat forward and
smashed out his cigarette. "This
may be important."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Oh, it is, it is. But not, I am
afraid, in the way you mean."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You can never tell. What have
you been doing?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Completing a unified theory of
life. Why a crystal grows but isn't
alive, why an organism that dies
isn't like a crystal. What is the
process we call life? What is its relationship
to the space-time continuum—"</p>
<p class="pnext">He said it so casually that Walker
was caught off his guard completely.
"Are you serious, Millet?" he
said.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Certainly. I expect to publish in
about two years."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Is this an independent effort?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"Not entirely. Others have contributed.
Some pioneers long dead,
some among the living." His eyes
twinkled. "You see, important
things beside the development of
weapons of destruction do continue
in the scientific world. Did you
think that was the end of everything
for me, ten years ago?" He
shook his head in mock gravity. "It
was just the beginning. I <em class="italics">wanted</em>
out, you see."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You wanted out?" Walker
leaned forward, unwilling to believe
what he had heard. "Are you
trying to tell me that you <em class="italics">arranged</em>
your discharge?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet shrugged. "Why, of course.
Nobody ever has bothered to ask
me about that up to now, but I
certainly did arrange it. It wasn't
hard, you know. All I had to do
was set up some sort of relationship
with a so-called security risk, and I
was on my way out."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Why ... that's damned near
treason."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Don't be silly. I had other important
things to do. In order to
do them—to continue work on the
unified life theory—it was necessary
for me to contact scientists with
whom professional relationships
were made illegal by security regulations.
The choice was simple; besides,
I didn't enjoy the idea of
spending my life developing ways
of destroying the very thing I
wanted most to understand."</p>
<p class="pnext">"This is fantastic, Millet, utterly
fantastic."</p>
<p class="pnext">"But true nonetheless. Walker,
you look like you could use a
drink."</p>
<p class="pnext">"By all means." He stared emptily
into the air, thinking about the
good old days.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Walker, a toast," said Millet,
holding a tall glass out to him. "To
scientific freedom."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker blinked. "By all means,"
he repeated hoarsely, and there was
a blurriness to his vision. "To scientific
freedom."</p>
<p class="pnext">They drank, and Walker said:
"I feel a bit freer to say what I
have come for."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Shoot," nodded Millet, sipping
his drink.</p>
<p class="pnext">"For security reasons, I'll talk in
generalities. But the basic fact is,
United Terra is faced with a serious
situation. It is most desirable that
the research you were conducting
when you left us, be continued."</p>
<p class="pnext">"There are a lot of other capable
physicists, both eager to be a part
of such activity and blessed with
security clearances."</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know very well, Millet,
that this was an unique, almost independent
line of development that
comes to a stop in your brain. Besides,"
and suddenly he felt silly,
"the lines of communication for research
which might enable us to
pick up where you left off, in time—too
much time—are somewhat
entangled in security." He glared.
"Don't laugh, Millet; it's a fact of
life which must be faced."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet finished his drink and set
the glass on an end table. "What
you're doing is asking me to come
back if you can arrange it."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker spread his hands. "Dr.
Millet, you have put it in a nutshell."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet shook his head, and for
the first time since their conversation
had started he frowned.
"Walker, you know how I feel
about developing weapons. I'm just
plain opposed to it."</p>
<p class="pnext">"The soldier is opposed to losing
his life, but many have to do just
that in the interests of civilization."</p>
<p class="pnext">"That serious, eh?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker crumpled under the
weight of his fear. "That serious,"
he said wearily.</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet thoughtfully relit his pipe.
"Of course, I'm not at all sure that
United Terra is very right in this
thing."</p>
<p class="pnext">"In times like these, that kind of
thought is out of bounds," snapped
Walker. "Whether you like it or
not, you are a part of this culture.
You might disapprove of many
things in it, but you don't want to
see it fall."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet puffed gently. "No, I suppose
not." Again the frown flickered
across his face. "I've been
very happy. I don't want my work
interrupted. It's too important,
Walker."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Undoubtedly this would more
than interrupt your work. It would
replace it."</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet's eyes drifted affectionately
about the room. "Most unpleasant."
A smile curled his lips.
"Frankly, though, I don't think you
can clear me again."</p>
<p class="pnext">"My problem."</p>
<p class="pnext">"Indeed." A weary resignation
seemed to settle over Millet, and
Walker suddenly felt very miserable.
"I suppose I'll have to accept,"
Millet said, pulling his pipe
out of his mouth and staring unhappily
at its trail of smoke.</p>
<hr class="docutils"/>
<p class="pfirst">Walker put his hands flat on his
desk and sighed deeply. Some of
the pressure, at least, was off; he
had managed to cancel part of the
Confederation's advantage. Terran
industrial strength and technological
supremacy, coupled with Millet's
genius, might yet equate, or at
least circumvent, the frightful
weapon the Confederation held.</p>
<p class="pnext">However, he still had to get Millet
back into the government.
Though, on the basis of the information
he had gained regarding
the scientist's motivations, and considering
the critical nature of the
situation, it shouldn't be too difficult.</p>
<p class="pnext">He clicked on his video and
dialed a secret line into Security
Data. Gyrating colors danced
across the screen before it went
black. He scowled, depressed the
cancel button, and dialed again;
this time, the black was finally replaced
by a recorded image, which
said, sweetly out of pouting red
lips,</p>
<p class="pnext">"This line is not cleared for the
Security Information you seek. The
problem you are handling should
be routed through an individual
permitted access to this information."
The image faded into blackness,
the sound track into static.</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker stared, stupefied. No line,
no contact, no source of information
had been denied to him in over
twelve years.</p>
<p class="pnext">His door swung open; he came
to his feet abruptly, furious that
someone should enter unannounced.</p>
<p class="pnext">He felt sickness strike him like a
fist in the stomach: Meriwether,
flanked by two security guards,
pushed through the door. His voice
slashed across the office like a
broadsword.</p>
<p class="pnext">"Walker, I'm shocked. Shocked.
And at a time like this...."</p>
<p class="pnext">Walker pounded his desk. "What
the hell is going on? I can't get
Security Data, you come marching
in here with security men ... what
gives?"</p>
<p class="pnext">Meriwether gestured to the
guards, and they came forward and
each took one of Walker's arms.
"You're out of a job, Walker,"
snarled General Marcus Meriwether.</p>
<p class="pnext">"In the name of God, <em class="italics">why</em>?"</p>
<p class="pnext">"You know very well. Take him
to security detention, Sergeant."</p>
<p class="pnext">And suddenly he knew. Meriwether
stared indignantly when he
started laughing. It was a hell of a
thing to laugh at, but it was also
the most hilarious tragedy he ever
hoped to encounter.</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet. <em class="italics">Security risk.</em> Untouchable.</p>
<p class="pnext">Millet would finish his great unified
theory, and go down in history
as neither Walker nor Meriwether
nor the genius who invented the
Confederation's neural weapon
would. Millet was as safe as he
could possibly want to be.</p>
<p class="pnext">And so was the Interplanetary
Confederation.</p>

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p class="pnext">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To

<p class="pfirst">Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing
the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status
with the IRS.</p>
<p class="pnext">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate">http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate</a></p>
<p class="pnext">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p class="pnext">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pfirst">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>
<p class="pnext">Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p class="pnext">Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>
<p class="pnext">Corrected <em class="italics">editions</em> of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is
renamed. <em class="italics">Versions</em> based on separate sources are treated as new
eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p>
